Discrete event simulation (DES) framework.

It's simple, templated and minimalistic.

Don't depend on a huge framework just to get a simple simulation
runnning.  The rest of the functionality needed, like the results
accumulation, you can get from the rich C++ standard library or the
Boost library, like Boost.Accumulator.
